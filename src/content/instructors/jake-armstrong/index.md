# Taco Tuesday

Every day is **taco ipsum** tuesday. Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat. Give me all your tacos. Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. Tacos, tacos, tacos. I’ve been following that `taco truck` around all day. How bout a gosh darn quesadilla? Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of cilantro. It’s raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos, don’t even ask why. Carne asada on corn tortillas.

## Wow

Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! Can you put some peppers and onions on that? Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of cilantro. Flour or corn tortillas? Side of rice and beans, please. I’d have to say, those tacos are on fleek. Burritos are very tasty. Make it a double there pal. 50 cent tacos! I’ll take 30. How bout a gosh darn quesadilla? Does guac cost extra? Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat. TACOS!! Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.

Give me all your tacos. It’s taco Tuesday Monday. Fish tacos with cabbage slaw and a side of chips and guac. TACOS!! Give me all your tacos. Give me all the tacos, immediately. Yeah, apparently the taco shack was robbed. They left the money but took the tacos. Say taco one more time. Pico de gallo, on the side please. Give me all your tacos. It’s taco Tuesday Monday. Can you put some peppers and onions on that? Tacos, tacos, tacos.
