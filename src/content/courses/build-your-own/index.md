# Taco Tuesday

Every day is **taco ipsum** tuesday. Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat. Give me all your tacos. Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. Tacos, tacos, tacos. I’ve been following that `taco truck` around all day. How bout a gosh darn quesadilla? Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of cilantro. It’s raining tacos, from out of the sky, tacos, don’t even ask why. Carne asada on corn tortillas.
